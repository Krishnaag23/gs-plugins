**"Prisma: Bridging Databases for Seamless Development. One Toolkit, Any Database."**

Prisma is a modern and open-source database toolkit that simplifies database access for developers. It offers a strongly typed query builder, schema migrations, support for various databases, real-time data synchronization, and enhanced security, making it a powerful tool for efficient and secure database interactions in web applications.

## Databases supported by Prisma 
Prisma supports a variety of data sources, allowing you to connect to and work with different database systems. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Prisma supports the following data sources:

1. **PostgreSQL**: Prisma has strong support for PostgreSQL, one of the most popular open-source relational database systems.

2. **MySQL**: Prisma can be used with MySQL, another widely used open-source relational database management system.

3. **SQLite**: SQLite is a serverless, self-contained, and zero-configuration database engine, and Prisma supports it as well.

4. **SQL Server**: Prisma offers support for Microsoft SQL Server, a popular commercial relational database management system.

5. **MongoDB (Experimental)**: Prisma also has experimental support for MongoDB, a NoSQL database, although this support may not be as mature as for relational databases.

6. **SQLite Prisma Client**: Prisma Client, the query builder and data access tool provided by Prisma, can also be used with SQLite, in addition to other databases.
